# Personal

This is a working monorepo for all things personal to me: Andrew Rust. This includes a handful of my publicly shared domains, configurations for software I use, goals I am actively or formerly pursuing, and other items that fall into the "publically personal" category. 

Directory Structure:
```
-Personal/
    -andrewrust.com/ - portfolio website(v4)
